## Project Flow

1. *System Initialization*
   - STM32F401 Blackpill is powered via USB.
   - UART (USART2) is initialized at 115200 baud for serial communication.
   - PA0 is configured as analog input for potentiometer reading.

2. *Timer Configuration*
   - Timer2 is configured to generate an interrupt at 100 Hz.
   - The timer interrupt is used only to trigger ADC sampling (flag-based).

3. *ADC Sampling*
   - On every timer interrupt, a flag is set to indicate ADC sampling request.
   - The actual ADC conversion is performed in the main loop to ensure stability.

4. *DMA Concept*
   - ADC data transfer behavior is simulated using interrupt-driven buffering.
   - This represents how ADC results are moved to memory without CPU blocking.

5. *UART Transmission*
   - The sampled ADC value is sent through USART2.
   - CP2102 USB-to-UART module converts UART data to USB.

6. *Serial Monitoring*
   - The ADC values (0–4095) are displayed on the Arduino Serial Monitor.
   - Rotating the potentiometer changes the ADC value in real time.
